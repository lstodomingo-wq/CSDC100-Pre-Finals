                <p>
                    For both instructors and students, responsible use involves understanding, evaluating, and familiarizing oneself with generative AI tools, regardless of whether they are formally incorporated into a course. This engagement requires using a thoughtful, critical, and ethical lens when determining if AI will benefit assignments and assessments.<br><br> Academics (researchers and professors) are identified as key stakeholders in AI ethics, responsible for developing the theory-based statistics, research, and ideas that support governments and corporations.<br><br> Key components of responsible use in teaching and learning include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognizing when and how generative AI is utilized.</li>
                    <li>Assessing the reliability and validity of AI-generated outputs.</li>
                    <li>Identifying the ethical and social implications stemming from AI design and use.</li>
                    <li>Creating and communicating with generative AI systems in appropriate ways.</li>
                    <li> Building literacy in Generative AI, which must intentionally address ethics, privacy, and equity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Within the writing process, generative AI can function as an assistant across a continuum of activities:
                </p>
                <table class="table table-striped">
                    <thead>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Researching, including finding initial sources, connections among ideas, and formatting references.</td>

                <h4 id="simple-list-item-2">Avoiding plagiarism and misuse</h4>
                <p>
                    The primary concern regarding academic misuse is that students might use chatbots to complete assignments, thereby bypassing the essential thinking and intellectual struggle involved in shaping ideas.<br><br> The consensus among many instructors is that turning in unedited AI-generated work as one’s own creation constitutes academic misconduct.<br><br> Guidelines for avoiding misuse include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Student Accountability:</strong> Students cannot blame AI for errors; they remain accountable for everything they submit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency and Reflection:</strong> A recommended practice is to require students to include a reflection at the end of a written assignment. This reflection should explain what AI tools were used, how they were used, and what the AI ultimately contributed to the written work. This practice also helps students develop metacognitive skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assignment Review:</strong> If an assignment can be easily completed by AI, instructors should consider revising it to be more authentic, focusing on real-world problems and issues.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Misuse can also involve privacy risks: Large Language Models (LLMs) may store conversations and use them as training data, meaning any input could become part of the model’s training set and potentially be shared without attribution. LLMs can also impersonate people and organizations and share intellectual property without attribution.
                </p>

                <h4 id="simple-list-item-3">Accuracy and verification of AI outputs</h4>
                <p>
                    A major caveat for generative AI is that it is programmed to generate answers, whether those answers are appropriate or not. AI tools are only as reliable as the data they were trained on.<br><br> Students must be aware that LLMs can provide inaccurate, misleading, and unethical information. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate AI output through a critical lens.<br><br> To ensure accuracy, students should be invited to consider these critical questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the AI-generated content accurate?</li>
                    <li>How can the accuracy be tested or assessed?</li>
                    <li>Can other credible sources (outside of generative AI) validate the data or item produced?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If a student uses AI to create a draft of a section or an entire paper, it is still up to them to edit, fact-check, and add their own voice and intellectual contributions. Students will need to check the work for AI-generated fabrication or errors.
                </p>

                <h4 id="simple-list-item-4">Bias and fairness</h4>
                <p>
                    AI ethics is important because AI technology is meant to augment or replace human intelligence, but the same issues that can cloud human judgment can seep into the technology. This is why AI ethics aims to foster a world with less bias and more fairness.<br><br> Sources of Bias: Bias can enter an AI system from several areas:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Training Data:</strong> If AI does not collect data that accurately represents the population, its decisions may be susceptible to historical biases. The content generated by LLMs is based on the learned language patterns and examples it receives. If the data is limited to a certain industry, language, demographic, or time period, the output will reflect that inherent bias, potentially perpetuating inequities.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Programmers:</strong> The individuals creating the AI may be biased.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Algorithm:</strong> The algorithm itself could be biased, perhaps by overweighting certain information.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>Consequences of Bias:</strong> AI projects built on biased or inaccurate data can lead to harmful consequences, particularly for underrepresented or marginalized groups and individuals. Examples include Amazon’s AI recruiting tool, which downgraded resumes featuring the word “women,” causing legal risk for the company. A biased AI tool can lead to inaccurate predictions, litigation (if a protected class is negatively impacted), and wrongheaded conclusions.<br><br> Addressing bias is a core principle of ethical AI, which promotes equal distribution and fairness while limiting discrimination. It is easier to incorporate a code of ethics during the development process to mitigate future risks. AI built with ethics at the core is capable of tremendous potential, such as assisting humans in making fairer choices and countering human biases
                </p>

                <h4 id="simple-list-item-5">Recommended guidelines</h4>
                <p>
                    Based on the information provided regarding responsible AI development and use in academia, the following guidelines are essential:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Maintain Academic Integrity and Transparency:</strong> Never submit unedited, AI-generated content as your original work; doing so constitutes academic misconduct. When using AI as an assistant, include a reflection detailing which tools were used, how they supported your process (e.g., idea generation, outlining, or drafting), and what you learned from the experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify and Critically Evaluate AI Outputs:</strong> Recognize that AI is prone to generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Always verify AI-generated facts, data, or arguments using external, credible sources before incorporating them into your work. You, not the AI, are ultimately accountable for all errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engage with AI Critically Regarding Bias:</strong>  Be aware that the training data underlying AI models often contains human and systemic biases, which the model will mimic and potentially perpetuate. When evaluating AI output, ask: "Who is represented in this data? Is the data inclusive in terms of scope and perspective?".</li>
                    <li><strong> Protect Your Data and Privacy:</strong> Understand that Large Language Models (LLMs) may store and use your conversational inputs (prompts) as future training data. Only share open information or data that does not need to remain private when interacting with these systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand the Process, Not Just the Product:</strong> Use AI to enhance the process of learning, such as brainstorming or editing, rather than relying on it to bypass the intellectual struggle necessary for developing essential skills.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4 id="simple-list-item-6">Analogy</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>AI in Dev Work:</strong>
                    You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders.

                        <div class="accordion-body">
                            Based on a metaphorical application of AI ethics principles, I would likely not agree to that deal. The proposed package lacks the necessary transparency and robustness required to justify a premium price, as the tools mentioned suggest a high reliance on automated, consumer-grade technology which parallels the ethical risk of relying on unverified generative AI output. The deal highlights a major ethical concern: charging a premium for a service where the underlying process is opaque or highly automated, similar to turning in unedited, AI-generated work as one’s own creation, which is defined as academic misconduct.<br><br> The "vibe coders" (the documentation team/developers) represent the creators of a system that prioritizes aesthetic output ("vibe") over transparent and responsible methodology, raising concerns about their integrity, creativity, and skill level. The integrity of the "vibe coders" is questionable because they are leveraging powerful but basic tools (iPhone, CapCut) to command a premium price, potentially creating a "black-box" system where the automated methodology is inscrutable to the client. Their creativity is likely reliant on the learned patterns of the generative tools, which is a major ethical concern in AI development. Their reliance on automated tools suggests a skill set focused primarily on prompting and basic assembly, rather than highly specialized technical craft.
